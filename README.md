# Educational Game to learn Newton's Laws of Motion
 
# Description of the teaching scenario  
The educational scenario begins with a pyramid of boxes one stack above the other. Every box has a 
specific mass which is labeled in the front of it. When the game starts, all o boxes remain in a state of 
inertia, as nothing at this moment alters their motion. In the next phase of the game, the player initiates 
interactions by inserting the mass and force of the sphere and then pressing the left key on the mouse 
to throw it. 
This procedure can be retrieved from the start as many times as the students’ need to observe 
the experiment. This interaction allows students to observe how varying masses and force affect the 
motion and behavior of the boxes, thereby illustrating the principles of Newton's Laws of Motion. 
Through this hands-on experience, students will deepen their understanding of inertia and the 
relationship between force and mass, enhancing their engagement with fundamental physics concepts. 
When the student is done with the game is moving forward to a quiz, through pushing the quiz button. 
In this scenery there are five evaluation questions to observe if students have gained the expected 
knowledge through playing. 


# Educational Context and Structure
According to Newton’s First Law (Law of Inertia), objects at rest remain at rest, and objects 
in motion remain in motion unless acted upon by an external force. This is clearly demonstrated 
as the boxes’ motional state change when interacted upon other things like the throwing sphere, 
showing how an external force affects its motion. 
Newton’s Laws of Motion Demonstrated: 

●  First Law (Inertia): The scenario begins by demonstrating that things remain at rest when 
no external force is applied.  

● Second Law (Force and Acceleration): The player launches spheres in the designated 
direction by pressing the left click of the mouse. Before this process begins, the user enters 
the mass and the force of the accelerating sphere, in order to observe the difference according 
to the data that have been entered. 

● Third Law (Action and Reaction): The player then observes how the spheres and boxes 
interact upon collision, in accordance with the Third Law (Action and Reaction). According to 
Newton's Third Law (for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction), when the sphere 
strikes the boxes, the boxes react by exerting an equal and opposite force. 
The force and mass of the contact determines whether the boxes move or bounce away.
